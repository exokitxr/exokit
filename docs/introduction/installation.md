> Get the Exokit Installer from [https://get.exokit.org/](https://get.exokit.org/).

This auto-detects your operating system and gives you the latest release. It includes the **Exokit Engine**.


## MacOS notes

MacOS Gatekeeper sometimes blocks new apps from running. To get around that, you might need to [right-click the downloaded `.dmg` file](https://www.howtogeek.com/205393/gatekeeper-101-why-your-mac-only-allows-apple-approved-software-by-default/) to accept the devloper certificate.

## Linux notes

You'll [need additional libraries installed](startDevelopment.html#linux-dependencies) for the Linux build to run.

## Alternate releases

[GitHub Releases](https://github.com/exokitxr/exokit/releases) has every alternate and past release.

> The Exokit installer just grabs the latest release from GitHub.

The releases are automatically built on every version update of the [GitHub repository](https://github.com/exokitxr/exokit).
