Installation Instructions
*************************

*** Using 'Makefile' ***

  just try 'make -j'

  This command will use the supplied 'makefile' file.
  This file can be customized to some extent.

  If you are missing the PNG or JPEG library, try the following:

To install libraries on Mac OS X:
 1. Install MacPorts (http://www.macports.org/install.php)
 2. Run "sudo port install jpeg"
 3. Run "sudo port install libpng"
 4. Run "sudo port install freeglut"

To install libraries on Linux:
 1. Run "sudo apt-get install libjpeg62-dev"
 2. Run "sudo apt-get install libpng12-dev"
 3. Run "sudo apt-get install freeglut3-dev"
 
*** Using CMake ***

  WARNING! Use a sub-directory (like 'build/') to build the targets
  with cmake. Otherwise, you might end up overwriting the initial
  'makefile' file with the one generated by cmake.

  Here is a possible command sequence:

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ../
    make -j

  The minimum cmake version required is 2.8.7

*** For Android, using NDK ***

  ndk-build

This should build the library (libsjpeg.a) as well as examples/sjpeg.
